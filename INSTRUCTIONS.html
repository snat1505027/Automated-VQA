# Instructions For Annotation Task
## Please read the instructions carefully!

For the main task, you will be required to follow these instructions carefully:

- You will be given an image and a question, your task is to take the image as the evidence and select the right answer from a drop-down list. Usually, the answer can fall into one of the following **six** categories:
    1. yes/no,
    2. a name of an object,
    3. a number (e.g., 1, 2, three etc),
    4. an attribute of an object (e.g., red, wooden, little, dark, striped etc.),
    5. relation between multiple objects (e.g., to the left of, on, above, etc.),
    6. the question itself is problematic.

   Other answer types may also be expected.
- **_"no"_** and **_"the question itself is problematic"_** have different meanings.
- It's important to bear in mind what we mean by "the question itself is problematic". A question will be **_PROBLEMATIC_** if:
  1. any of the objects mentioned in the question is not present in the image, (e.g., given an image with no shirt, the question 'What pattern does the shirt on the floor have in the picture?' is problematic.)
  2. the realation between any two objects mentioned in the question is not correct according to the image, (e.g., given an image where a shirt is located to the right of the hat, the question What is the color of the shirt located to the left of the hat? is problematic.)
  3. any of the objects has attribute mentioned in the question that is not correct according to the image (e.g., given an image where a man is wearing red shirt, the question What is the man wearing blue shirt doing in the image? is problematic.).
- Since the drop-down list contains lots of candidates, you might want to type the first few characters of the answer word in your mind to narrow down the search.

**In this qualification task, you are going to do exactly the same thing as the main task (10 times) and we will score you based on your answers. If you achieve 8 out of 10 or higher, you will pass and will be qualified to do the main task.**
